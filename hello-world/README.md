# Hello, World!

Of course I had to do a Hello World program. They both ran pretty fast, but that's not saying much since all they're doing is printing "Hello, world!" in my console.

## Go

```
real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.001s
```

## Hack

```
real    0m0.313s
user    0m0.211s
sys     0m0.078s
```
