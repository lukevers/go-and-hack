# Go And Hack

This is just for fun! I realize that [Go](http://golang.org/) is a compiled language while [Hack](http://hacklang.org/) is a scripted language, but I consider myself to be fairly fluent in Go, and I want to learn Hack some more. I also understand that these are probably not the best languages to compare, but _why not_? I can do whatever I want, and I'm going to! The structure of this repo is going to be a folder for each example which contains both a Hack file and a Go file and a README which has results from these examples.
